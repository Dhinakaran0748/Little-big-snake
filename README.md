# Little-big-snake
Excited to share one of the most fun and practical experiences from my internship at QSpiders — I got the chance to code a game called Little Big Snake! 🐍🎮 It was a truly engaging way to apply my learning in Full Stack Development, and it made the coding process both challenging and enjoyable.
